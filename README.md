# Diwali Sales Data Exploration Project


Welcome to the Diwali Sales Data Exploration Project! This project aims to analyze and understand the trends and patterns in sales data during the festive season of Diwali. By digging deep into the data, we hope to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and purchasing decisions, ultimately leading to better informed business strategies for future Diwali campaigns.

This project is exploratory in nature, meaning we will be asking questions and seeking answers without pre-defined hypotheses. We will use various data analysis techniques to uncover hidden patterns, identify key drivers of sales, and assess the effectiveness of existing marketing campaigns.

The project aims to address questions such as:
<ul>

We look forward to sharing our findings and insights as the project progresses!
